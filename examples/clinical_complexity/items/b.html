It was a pleasure to see B in respiratory clinic today with his long term
foster carer J.  He has made an excellent recovery since his admission in
January with pneumonia, which resulted in him requiring intubation and
ventilation for 4 days on PICU.
</p>
<p>
B feels that his exercise tolerance is now back to his normal baseline.
Spirometry as attached demonstrates a restrictive defect however we have no
baseline for comparison for B. Chest x-ray repeated today shows that the small
effusion he had has completely resolved, however it does highlight that his
kyphoscoliosis appears to be worsening steadily, and it is likely that this
accounts to some degree for the severity of his last illness. He has an
appointment to see the complex spines team at X in the next 2 weeks to discuss
whether spinal surgery may be of benefit to him.
</p>
<p>
B continues to see the community paediatricians 6 monthly . He tells me today
that his progress at his new secondary school has been good and he has been
getting A grades for maths and science subjects.  He is settled at home and has
been with his current foster carers now for over 4years with the legal process
to formally adopt him ongoing.
</p>
<p>
As B already has comprehensive care from multiple paediatric teams I have
discharged him from our clinic today; however should you have any further
concerns about his respiratory status please do not hesitate to re-refer him.
