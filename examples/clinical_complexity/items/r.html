R was seen in audiology for advice regarding his severe hyperacusis. This is
causing a lot of problems in noisy environments and he tends to cry a lot in
his preschool which is causing problems. His speech is developing and he now
has about 10 words. He does not yet, however, respond reliably to requests and
some Makaton is being used to supplement verbal communication. Hw continues
under the Speech and language therapist.

Mother mentioned that his feeding has reduced and become slower and on
examination, his breathing was laboured and effortful. Mouth and tonsils
appeared normal. I should be grateful for your urgent assessment given the
history.

I have discharged him from audiology
