M was seen in the neuromuscular clinic with both parents. He has been stable
from the chest point of view, but is having increasing postural problems in his
seating. These have been exacerbated by a growth spurt, which has caused
problems with his spinal brace. He is currently off school, as he can only
tolerate very short periods in his chair. Unfortunately his voluntary movement
is now so limited me can no longer operate his own powered wheelchair with his
thumb. This will be reassessed by our team.

His most recent admission was for constipation and he continues to complain of
some abdominal discomfort and distension at times. There likely to be an
element of gut dymotility.
