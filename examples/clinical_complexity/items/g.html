I reviewed G at the respiratory clinic with his sister. He remains stable and
parents are continuing to manage his needs without recourse to hosptial. The
time he needs to spend each day on CPAP and his oxygen flow rate is steadily
increasing and is now about 16hrs/day. This is likely to be due to a
combination of central apnoeas, progressive scoliosis, secretion management and
the continuous epileptic activity seen on EEG.

Although he has marked contractures in all limbs, his parents feel he is
comfortable at present. We discussed his advanced care plan and he remains for
admission for reversible problems and basic life support, but not for
intubation or intensive care.

We will review him in 6 months.
