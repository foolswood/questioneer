It was lovely to see M and his father in respiratory fast track review clinic
today. He was discharged two  weeks ago after a 3 day inpatient stay for lower
respiratory tract infection. He has now been started on long-term antibiotics,
as he has been admitted to the ward on four occasions this year so far.
Admissions are triggered by aspiration and exacerbated by frequent, prolonged
seizures, which he continues to have several times daily. His parents manage
these with administration of buccal midazolam once or twice a day. His VP shunt
continues to be difficult to manage and he is under the care of neurosurgery at
Y hospital.

On examination today M looked comfortable supported in his wheelchair. Advice
was given about care of his skin around his nasal oxygen prongs, as there was
some excoriation under the tapes. Upper airway noises were heard on his chest
consistent with secretions.  His parents were advised to persist with chest
physio.

We will see him again in 6 months time.
