<h3>Problems</h3>
Downs Syndrome <br/>
Poor speech articulation <br/>
Overweight <br/>
Challenging behaviour <br/>
Single mother

<p>
X was seen in the neurodevelopmental clinic for a review on request of her
school. There are concerns about her behaviour, particularly that when outdoors
she will run off with no concept of danger and then when tired will sit on the
ground and refuse to move. She is also becoming upset at the start and end of
every school day, such that hand overs now happen in a separate area to avoid
disruption to the class.
</p>

<p>
She continues to attend a mainstream school with an Education Health and Care
Plan in place but educational progress is very limited and she is still
functioning at a preschool level. In the playground, she tends to prefer to
spend time doing repetitive activities such as spinning around a tree or
throwing leaves and watching them fall. She rarely seeks interaction with other
children and may become upset if they approach her. Her mother is concerned
that she is behaving like a child with autism and school share this view.

Apart from her weight and the signs of Downs, examination was unremarkable.

<h3>Plan</h3>

<p>
I have agreed to arrange a specific assessment of the possibility of
co-existing autism spectrum disorder, but unfortunately there is a substantial
waiting time of several months. This will involve specific speech therapy
review to take into account her speech difficulties. In the meantime, some
behavioural support will be offered by the psychology service.

Mum is aware she needs to watch her weight and routine thyroid function tests
were checked (results normal).
