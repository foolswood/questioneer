I saw M and her mother in orthopaedic clinic today to review wound healing and
outcome after her bilateral hip adductor release procedure two months ago. Her
wounds have healed well, and X-ray today demonstrates and improved position of
the hip joints bilaterally. M’s family however remain very concerned about her
posture in her chair.
</p>
<p>
As M has no independent mobility the procedure was done to improve comfort
during care and seating position. Unfortunately, although the previous pressure
sore on the right side has healed a new small area has opened over the sacrum.
There are still difficulties maintaining a comfortable sitting posture in her
wheelchair. They continue to see their community nurse regarding pressure area
care and the tissue viability team is now involved.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise M has been stable and doing reasonably well- she has had 5 seizures
in the last month and these are sometimes triggered by pain. She has not needed
any hospital admissions.
</p>
<p>
I will contact her occupational therapy team as I feel M requires an urgent
review of her seating. We will see her again in one year to review her
progress.
