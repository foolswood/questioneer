K was seen with his aunt in cardiology clinic today. He has had a rocky 6
months mainly due to significant behavioural problems around feeding. His aunt
tells me that he has always been a picky eater but has developed much more
restrictive patterns of eating in the last year, to the point now where he has
lost 2kg in weight in the last 6 months. He is under the dieticians and sees
the psychologist through the complex feeding clinic for this.

His family have not noticed any episodes of cyanosis, and he has not collapsed-
he remains an active boy, but cannot keep up with his younger sister when
running now. Latest ECHO indicated that his pulmonary pressures are stable and
his pulmonary hypertension mild, but he continues to require home oxygen. This
is likely exacerbated by his large tonsils and adenoids which are felt to be
the cause of his sleep apnoea as even in the day he mouth-breathes. We will
continue to closely monitor K and are planning staged repair of the AVSD as
soon as possible before the pulmonary hypertension worsens. This will also be
dependent on his growth and nutritional status improving.

I will liase with the feeding clinic team and make an appointment for K in the
cardiology pre-op complex needs assessment clinic as I feel he would benefit
from this.
