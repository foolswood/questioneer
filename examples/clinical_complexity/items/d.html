It was lovely to see D looking so well with her mother in gastroenterology
clinic today. I have attached her nutrition clinic report, but in essence she
has been doing well over the past year and continues to grow along the 9th
centiles for height and weight. With the input of the feeding clinic she has
started to improve in terms of her oral feed aversion and now takes part in
family mealtimes. Her enteral calorie intake and absorption however remains
negligible and she has TPN over 22hours at home. Her parents are coping well
with this and she has had only one admission this year with fever as suspected
line sepsis which was subsequently shown on NPA culture to be likely due to a
rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infection.

D opens her bowels daily with type 4-6 stools and has now started toilet
training by day. This has improved her previous problems with nappy rash
significantly and her skin looked good today. She is known to the CDT with
moderate global delay and has started nursery with 1:1 support.

<p>
Her family continue to aim for rehousing to larger accommodation better able to
meet the medical needs of D and also those of her 4 siblings. I have written a
letter of medical support to this effect for the family today. I will see them
again in clinic in 4 months.
