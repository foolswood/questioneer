It was a pleasure to see Y and his father today in gastroenterology clinic. It
is now just over a year since Y had a gastrostomy tube to replace his previous
nasogastric feeding tube.  He continues on 4hourly feeds as per the enclosed
dietician plan. He appears to be thriving on this with his weight and height
moving up through the centile lines.
</p>
<p>
In the last year he has had no further episodes of chest infection and I feel
this can be attributed to a combination of the gastrostomy feeding, good
control of his previous gastro-oesophageal reflux. His motor skills have now
caught up to age appropriate levels, and he is  running and jumping. However he
is somewhat less interactive than his twin sister. His receptive language still
appears delayed and his parents continue to have concerns about his hearing.

<p>
He is due for admission under the ENT surgeons again next week for MLB and
grommets for his glue ear. Timing of future cleft palate surgery and possibly
definitive airway surgery is yet to be decided.He has also been referred to the
child development team for detailed assessment of development.
</p>
<p>
His parents are keen to consider change of the gastrostomy to a button device
but otherwise are very happy to continue as things are, whilst Y is generally
well. I will write a referral to the paediatric surgeons for this, and will see
Y and his family again in clinic in 6 months time.
