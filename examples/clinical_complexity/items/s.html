It was a pleasure to see S and his family again in joint gastro-nutrition
clinic today to review his feeding plan and consider insertion of a
gastro-jejunostomy tube.
</p>
<p>
S has avoided PICU admissions for lower respiratory tract infections so far
this year but has been admitted to the ward twice for antibiotics. Although it
is difficult to tell he he has symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux his mother
on occasion has seen him grimace after feeds are given.  Speech and language
team continue to reassess S regularly but still feel at present that this
swallow is unsafe for all except very thick purees, even when well positioned
and with good head support. NG feed has been used until now to maintain S's
calorie intake, but given the probable reflux with aspiration episodes, his
faltering growth and delayed puberty I feel we cannot delay any longer in
providing a safer enteral feeding route for S. Additionally his parents find
giving his medication via NG difficult and it frequently blocks.  I have
re-discussed with his parents today regarding insertion of a tube and they are
willing to meet with the paediatric surgeons to discuss this.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise S has been stable; his focal seizures are now infrequent and well
controlled. He continues to see the neurology team regularly, and his parents
are continuing to investigate possible novel treatments in America for his
underlying autoimmune encephalopathy. He is well known to the community
paediatric team and community paediatric nurses who review his Hickman line.
</p>
<p>
I will make a referral to the paediatric surgeons for consideration of
jejunostomy insertion and will see S again after this appointment. In the
meantime please find attached a copy of the current feed plan.
