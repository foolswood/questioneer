E was reviewed today in the neurology clinic along with her parents and a
Somali interpreter.  She has recently started in reception at X special school,
and her parents feel that she seems to enjoy going here and they are finding
the placement very helpful as a family.
</p>
<p>
From the point of view of her seizures things have been going reasonably well
and her parents do not think she has had any further seizures since March, when
she had an intercurrent viral illness associated with a small cluster of 3
short generalised tonic-clonic seizures . She was managed at home as per her
plan with rescue medication and reviewed in A+E but did not require admission.
Her anti-epileptic doses were all reviewed at this time.

<p>
Otherwise she continues to see multiple different specialities and is under the
care of a local community paediatrician to co-ordinate this multi-disciplinary
care. Her current challenges are with severe reflux causing her to vomit after
most PEG feeds and sometimes after medication. Her weight has dropped 1kg in
the last 6 months.  She has had several admissions to hospital this year with
lower respiratory tract infection  secondary to aspiration. In view of all
these factors she is due to see the paediatric gastroenterologists next week to
review her enteral feed and consider a change to a jejunostomy.
</p>
<p>
As her seizures are currently well controlled I will leave her anti-epileptic
medication as it is today and plan to review her in 6 months time. If however
there are any concerns about her seizure control, then please do not hesitate
to get in touch via the epilepsy CNS.
